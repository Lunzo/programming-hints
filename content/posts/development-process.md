I highly recommend having a read through this talk: [Move Fast and Break Nothing](http://zachholman.com/talk/move-fast-break-nothing/). There are some great ideas in it on continuous development, testing, communication and learning/teaching on the job. Well worth the time to read through and think about whether you can apply some of the points in it to your work.

A note about this blog: I'm going to try and get into a more regular cadence of posts. If you see the gap in the history from May to August it's because I was in the process of moving overseas. I'm well and truly settled into my new home now so I have no excuse for sporadic updates [Ed (2022): this didn't happen].
