Here's a talk that I watched recently and found deeply troubling and thought provoking: [Haunted by Data - Maciej Ceglowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAXLHM-1Psk) [(text/image version)](http://idlewords.com/talks/haunted_by_data.htm). The speaker raises the ethical dilemmas with user data collection, retention, governance and overuse that is prevalent throughout the computing industry. The challenge is to end our addiction to collecting and storing user data.

Here's another post on the related topic of [the web being "subsidized" by advertising](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773). It's related because internet advertising relies on the user data harvested when we do anything online. Also worth reading and thinking about.
