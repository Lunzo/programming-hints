Long time, no post. I've had plenty of ideas for topics to write about, but for one reason or another I've always put off actually sitting down and writing the post. Call it procrastination, call it finding better things to do with my spare time - whatever the excuse I've made them all.

Seeing as I'm paying for the domain name and hosting, I might as well post occasionally. Will this be a one off or will I get into a regular cadence of updates? Only time will tell.

The actual topic of the post is my favourite Firefox add-ons. I was prompted to list them here because I recently reset my Firefox install and it took me a while to find the best add-on.

Here is my must-have list:

1. [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) - this is the best add-on ever. It arranges your tabs down the left hand side of the browser and nests them like the old tree view in windows explorer. This is surprisingly impossible to find with Firefox's add-ons search even if you type the exact name.
1. [ublock origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) - ad blocking. The web is so much more pleasant to read without popup ads everywhere and blinking gifs on the side of your article. I previously used Adblock Edge but support for that has been discontinued.
1. [LastPass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager/) - I can't do without my password manager. If LastPass isn't right for you then find one that is, but in 2015 you should be using one of these.
1. [Add Dictionaries](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools/) - unless you're happy with the default en-US of course.


### 2022 Update
Firebug (a great website debuging tool in the early 2010s) was on the original list in 2015 but it looks like it no longer exists. The inbuilt Firefox developer tools are really good these days.

This is my only post that ever got a non-spam comment on the old Wordpress programming-hints. A poster called Daniel wrote:

I'm not sure I agree though. I usually don't click accept and instead find the option that downloads the least cookies when presented with the cookie annoying popups.
